# The .bazelignore file configures Bazel to ignore directories (recursively) or
# files inside a workspace, i.e. Not consider them part of that workspace. There
# are various reasons to do that. One common one is that you have a separate
# Bazel workspace in a directory.

# Nested projects that should be moved into the root workspace:
angular/
angular-ngc/
bufbuild/
bzlmod/
check-npm-determinism/
directory_path/
eager-fetch/
