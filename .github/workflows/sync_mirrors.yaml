# We maintain mirrors of this repo for demonstrating Aspect Workflows on other CI platforms.
# This is documented in /.aspect/workflows/README.md.
# The primary repo is tested on Buildkite because it's the best
# https://buildkite.com/aspect/bazel-examples
# When commits land there, we sync them to the others:
# CircleCI: https://buildkite.com/aspect/bazel-examples-cci
# GitHub Actions: https://buildkite.com/aspect/bazel-examples-gha
