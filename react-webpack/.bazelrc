# Load any settings & overrides specific to the current user from `.aspect/bazelrc/user.bazelrc`.
# This file should appear in `.gitignore` so that settings are not shared with team members. This
# should be last statement in this config so the user configuration is able to overwrite flags from
# this file. See https://bazel.build/configure/best-practices#bazelrc-file.
