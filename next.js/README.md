# Next.js Bazel example

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and then Bazelified.

TypeScript transpilation and type checking has been broken out into fine-grained `ts_project` targets.
This is a small example with only two Typescript source directories so the performance benefit of using fine grained targets will be negligible here.

In a large application or monorepo, splitting Typescript transpilation & type checking across many targets can speed up the build with parallelization and caching. It also allows for massive parallelization with remote execution. Read
https://blog.aspect.dev/typescript-with-rbe for more information on using remote execution with Typescript.

NB: The example is not 100% complete and there are some minor TODOs in the code including a TODO for running linting under Bazel.

## Usage

The `package.json` scripts have been updated to call Bazel instead of Next.js so these scripts can be
used as they would be in a typical Next.js configuration.

### Setup

First run `pnpm install`. Bazel itself doesn't depend on the `node_modules` folder layed out in the
source tree but it is needed so your editor can find typings and for running `ibazel` without having
to install it globally. `ibazel` is a wrapper around bazel that adds watch mode used when running the
devserver.

### Building

Run `pnpm run build`. This runs `bazel build //app:next`. The output `.next` folder can be found under
`bazel-bin/.next`.

### Production server

Run `pnpm run start`. This runs `ibazel run //app:next_start`.

### Development server

Run `pnpm run dev`. This runs `ibazel run //app:next_dev`.

### Running tests

There are no tests in this example. None came pre-baked [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). When tests are added they would be run by Bazel with `bazel test`.

TODO: add some Jest tests run with [rules_jest](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_jest) and perhaps a Cypress test once Aspect rules_cypress, currently in development, is ready.

### Styles

This example only has the .css styles generated by [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). These don't require any build steps. Showing how to create fine grained
targets to pre-process `.scss` and `.less` into `.css` would be useful in this example in the future.

TODO: add .scss and/or .less styles and pre-process targets

### Linting

Run `pnpm run lint`. This still runs the vernacular `next lint`.

TODO: run linting under Bazel

### Releasing and deploying

This examples doesn't directly cover releasing and deploying a Next.js application built with Bazel
but it should not diverge much from releasing and deploying a Next.js application built outside of Bazel
since the output of the Bazel build is the shape as the output you would get from running the vernacular
Next.js tooling, namely a `.next` folder with all of the output artifacts that application is
comprised of:

```
$ pnpm run build

```

When built with Bazel, this folder doesn't end up as `.next` in your source tree
because Bazel doesn't write output files to the source tree. Instead the folder can be found
via the `bazel-bin` symlink create by Bazel as `bazel-bin/.next`. You release and deploy tooling
would use this folder after running the Bazel build.
